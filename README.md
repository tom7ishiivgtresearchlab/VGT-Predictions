## 📋 About This Repository

This repository contains timestamped, pre-observation scientific predictions from **Virtual Gravitational Theory (VGT)** to be verified by future observations. All predictions are recorded **before** the availability of verification data.

**Purpose:** To provide transparent, falsifiable predictions that can be objectively tested against future astronomical observations.

## 🎯 Current Predictions

### Theoretical Framework (November 5, 2025)

Virtual Gravitational Theory provides a first-principles derivation of cosmological dynamics through quantum corrections to general relativity. At currently accessible observational scales, VGT predictions converge to ΛCDM with precision ΔG/G < 0.1%, while maintaining fundamentally different theoretical structure.

---

### Key Parameters

**Quantum Correction Scale:**
- ε ~ 0.001–0.005 (based on 1-loop quantum corrections)
- Uncertainty reflects UV completion scenario dependence

**Observational Convergence:**
- Current observational precision: ΔG/G < 0.1% (indistinguishable from ΛCDM)
- DESI-II sensitivity (2027): ΔG/G ~ 0.01% (transition regime)
- Future high-precision surveys: Distinguishable signatures expected

**Structure Formation:**
- Growth rate modification: Δfσ₈/fσ₈ ~ 1–3%
- Scale-dependent effects at k > 0.1 h/Mpc
- Verification target: DESI-II + Euclid (2027)

---

### Theoretical Context

VGT does not claim to directly resolve specific observational tensions (e.g., H₀ or σ₈). The framework provides theoretical insight through:

1. First-principles derivation of the cosmological constant
2. Scale-dependent gravitational coupling  
3. Quantum corrections to cosmological dynamics

**Primary value:** Theoretical understanding of why ΛCDM works observationally, while providing deeper foundation and testable predictions at higher precision.

## 📖 What is Virtual Gravitational Theory (VGT)?

Virtual Gravitational Theory is a unified theoretical framework spanning quantum to cosmological scales, providing first-principles derivation of the cosmological term through quantum corrections to general relativity.

**Key Features:**
- Dynamic cosmological term: Λ(z) = Λ₀(1+z)^ε
- Unified treatment of black holes, neutron stars, and cosmic expansion
- Testable predictions across multiple observational domains
- UV completeness through asymptotic safety
- Autonomous completion: All physical constraints satisfied by internal consistency

**Theoretical Advantages Over ΛCDM:**

1. **Origin of Λ:** Derived from quantum corrections (not ad hoc constant)
2. **UV Completeness:** Renormalization group stability ensured
3. **Theoretical Closure:** No fine-tuning required
4. **Testability:** Combined cosmological + collider signatures

**Historical Analogy:**  
Like general relativity vs Newtonian gravity, VGT explains why ΛCDM works observationally while providing deeper theoretical foundation and subtle but measurable differences at higher precision.

**Title:** "Virtual Gravity Theory IV: Autonomous Completion through Self-Consistent Running Coupling Dynamics"

**Journal:** Physical Review D  
**Submitted:** November 3, 2025 (revised November 6, 2025)

**Significance:**  
Demonstrates autonomous completion—a framework where all physical constraints emerge from internal consistency without ad hoc assumptions.
