## 📋 About This Repository

This repository contains timestamped, pre-observation scientific predictions from **Virtual Gravitational Theory (VGT)** to be verified by future observations. All predictions are recorded **before** the availability of verification data to ensure scientific integrity and establish priority.

**Purpose:** To provide transparent, falsifiable predictions that can be objectively tested against future astronomical observations.

## 🎯 Current Predictions

### H₀ Tension Contribution (November 5, 2025)

**Prediction Summary:**
- VGT predicts ε ∼ 0.001–0.01 based on 1-loop quantum corrections
- Expected H₀ tension reduction: 10–20% (ΔH₀ ≈ 0.6–1.1 km/s/Mpc)
- Verification target: DESI-II Data Release (November 2027)

**Documents:**
- [English Version](H0_Tension_VGT_Prediction_2025-11-05_EN.md)

## 📖 What is Virtual Gravitational Theory (VGT)?

Virtual Gravitational Theory is a unified theoretical framework spanning quantum to cosmological scales, providing first-principles derivation of the cosmological term through quantum corrections to general relativity.

**Key Features:**
- Dynamic cosmological term: Λ(z) = Λ₀(1+z)^ε
- Unified treatment of black holes, neutron stars, and cosmic expansion
- Testable predictions across multiple observational domains

**Current Status:**
- VGT Volume 1 (Phases 1-20): Complete
- VGT I-IV Papers: Under peer review (Physical Review D)
- VGT V: In preparation (2026)

## 🔬 Scientific Integrity

### Timestamp Verification

All predictions in this repository are timestamped through:

1. **GitHub commit history** - Automatic timestamps for all file modifications
2. **Zenodo DOI** - Permanent, immutable archive with assigned DOI
3. **CITATION.cff metadata** - Machine-readable citation information

### Immutability Guarantee

Once a prediction is published through a GitHub Release and archived on Zenodo:
- ✅ Files cannot be modified or deleted
- ✅ Timestamp is permanently recorded
- ✅ DOI provides persistent identifier
- ✅ Independent verification is possible

### Falsifiability

Each prediction includes:
- Specific quantitative claims
- Clear success/failure criteria
- Defined verification timeline
- Explicit model assumptions
